# The Ålesund Biomechanical Lab (ÅBL) Robot Arm Architecture
Welcome to the ÅBL's repository for the KUKA LBR med 14 robot arm! This repository contains all the code and configurations required to operate and control our robotic system.

## About the Project
The project is based on ROS2 and contains multiple packages configured for our robot, as well as a Dockerfile where you either can run it virtually or use as a guide to install on the lab PC.

The ROS2 packages used in this project:
